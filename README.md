# React + TypeScript + Vite

This repository contains 25 small React projects that I created to help master React development. By building these projects, I gained hands-on experience with various React concepts and techniques, preparing myself for job interviews as a React developer. These projects are inspired by the video series "Master React by building 25 different projects."

## How to Run the Projects

Follow these steps to set up and run the projects:

1. **Clone the repository**:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/25-small-react-projects.git
  cd 25-small-react-projects
  ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
  Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

3. **Run the development server**:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

4. **Open the project in your browser**:
  Open your browser and navigate to vite default port `http://localhost:5173` to see the project running.

5. **Build the project for production**:
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

6. **Preview the production build**:
  ```sh
  npm run serve
  ```

  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to preview the production build.

7. **Lint and format the code**:
  ```sh
  npm run lint
  npm run format
  ```

Follow these steps for each project within the repository.
